Music Recommendation System

Music recommender system is a system which learns from the users past listening history and recommends them songs which they would probably like to hear in
future. The project involves implementation of various algorithms to build an effective music recommender system.

● Firstly, it involves implementation of Non-Personalized popularity based
model which provides each song in descending order of popularity skipping those
songs already consumed by the user.
● The recommender system also provides the user with the greatest hits of the
artist that the user has already listened to.
● Collaborative filtering algorithms which predict (filtering) taste of a user by
collecting preferences and tastes from many other users (collaborating) is also
implemented.
● The project also involves experiments on content based models, based on
latent factors and metadata.

The Data set to be used is provided by Million Song Data Challenge hosted by
Kaggle. It was released by Columbia University Laboratory for the Recognition
and Organization of Speech and Audio. The dataset includes meta-data (e.g., artist
identifiers, tags, etc.), audio content analysis and standardized identifiers for all the
songs.
